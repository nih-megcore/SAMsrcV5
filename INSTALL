Installation instructions for the SAM suite.

0.  Pre-requisites: gsl, gsl-devel, blas, blas-devel, fftw, and fftw-devel.
    If you wish to use GIFTI atlases, you will also need gifticlib,
    gifticlib-devel, nifticlib, and nifticlib-devel.
    AFNI is optional but recommended.

1.  Review the settings in config/Makefile.config. The executables will go
    into BDIR, and library files will go into LIBDIR.

1b. Also check config/Makefile.site.EXAMPLE; lines like those in that file
    can be put into a file called config/Makefile.site which will be used
    and not overwritten by a new version.

2.  At the top level, run "make".

3.  Either include the BDIR in your $PATH, or

        cd config
        make symlinks DEST=/path/to/bin

    Just typing

        make symlinks

    will create links in $HOME/bin. The executables are already configured
    to use the LIBDIR directory.
